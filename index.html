<h1>Flick – Privacy Policy</h1>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>
    Flick is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy outlines how your personal data is handled when you use the Flick mobile application ("App").
</p>

<h2>2. No Data Collection</h2>
<p>
    Flick does not collect, transmit, or store any personal data on servers or external services. All data you create within the app — including mood entries, voice notes, photos, and comments — is saved directly on your device only.
</p>

<h2>3. Data Control</h2>
<p>
    You are in full control of your data. If you uninstall the app or manually delete its data from your device, all stored information will be permanently erased. We cannot retrieve or recover lost data.
</p>

<h2>4. Permissions</h2>
<p>
    The App may request access to the following device features:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Camera:</strong> to attach photos to your mood entries</li>
    <li><strong>Microphone:</strong> to record voice notes</li>
    <li><strong>Storage:</strong> to save media locally</li>
    <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> to send reminders or mood prompts</li>
</ul>
<p>
    These permissions are used strictly for enhancing your experience within the app and are never used to collect or share your personal data.
</p>

<h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>
    Flick does not use third-party analytics, advertising, or cloud storage providers. Your usage and data remain private and confined to your device.
</p>

<h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>
    Flick is designed for general audiences and does not knowingly collect any data from children. Because we do not collect data, no personally identifiable information is processed.
</p>

<h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>
    This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Any changes will be posted within the App and will take effect immediately.
</p>
